# Text Prefixing in Python

## Introduction

This is a simple Python script that prefixes text in a file. It was created to prefix text in a txt file, but it can be used for any file type.

## Usage

The script takes 2 arguments:

1. The path to the file to be prefixed
2. The path to the output file

If the output file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be overwritten.

## Example

```bash
python main.py README.md README2.md
```
